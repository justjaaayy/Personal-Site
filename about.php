<div class="about">
<p>For many years I've had a <b>passion</b> for flat, modern and clean minimalistic design. 
I'm always looking for new ways to find creative solutions to problems and as of recently I've been
getting hooked on not only making beautiful designs for the web but also making them interactive too, so I decided to dive head first into 
web development.</p>
